# web-contracts

A small set of **boring, battle-tested frontend contracts**.

These documents are not “best practices”.
They are **explicit interfaces** between:
- structure and content
- build-time and runtime
- components and orchestration
- developers and editors

If you adopt a contract, you also accept its boundaries.

## What this repo is
- Short documents (5–10 min each)
- Each contract includes: intent, non-goals, rules, examples, failure modes

## What this repo is not
- Not a framework
- Not a design system
- Not a blog
- Not a set of “tips & tricks”

## Contracts
- [0001 — Layout is code, content is data](./contracts/0001-layout-is-code-content-is-data.md)
- [0002 — State ownership](./contracts/0002-state-ownership.md)
- 0003 — Build-time first
- 0004 — Frameworks are optional
- 0005 — Accessibility baseline
- 0006 — Events, not callbacks
- 0007 — No implicit coupling
- 0008 — CSS does the heavy lifting
- 0009 — Runtime is a tax

## Using these contracts
Pick 1–3 contracts and apply them to a project. Don’t adopt everything at once.

If you disagree with a contract, open an issue explaining:
- your context
- what broke
- what alternative contract you propose
